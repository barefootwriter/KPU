* Most class time facilitated by students (learners)
* Emphasis on group work and self-reflection
* Instructor facilitates process of learners facilitating one another
* Instructor content delivery limited (10 minutes or less)
* Instructor only delivers content not available in readings (e.g. contextual knowledge)
* Learners create self-directed projects
* Evaluation includes self-assessment, peer assessment, interviews
* No exams, no small assignments, no multiple choice tests
* Group work represents 25-50% of the grades
* Individual, self-directed projects represent 50-75% of grades

##### How well does it work?
