Prepared for the HSCC meeting,\\
March 16, 2012

\section{Question 1: Online Presence}

\subsection{Part One}

\begin{quote}
In the Learning Objectives/Outcomes, there is no clear indication of a comparative/critical approach to the question of how writers/artists currently establish and/or actively subvert the production of their "online presence."
\end{quote}

We are interested in helping students find voice and place on the Web. Our goals focus on awareness, confidence, creativity, and community. This course is not intended to explore questions such as "how writers/artists... actively subvert the production of their online presence." On the other hand, those themes -- as well as many others, such as privacy, digital citizenship, online identity and the risks and benefits of online presence -- are explored in the prerequisite course, CRWR 1240. 

In Creative Writing, we do not exert a particular bias that students should, or should not, subvert or promote their online presence. We do not determine what students should think or believe. Rather, our courses help students explore the landscape of their intended careers.

This approach is consistent with other departments and courses at Kwantlen. For example, the Fine Arts department offers a course entitled "Digital Media: Interactive Art on the Web," the title of which is as follows:

\begin{quote}
"Students will expand their knowledge of various digital software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Director, and Flash. They will apply these programs to create artwork that will encompass digital stills, online work, installation, video and sound. Students will also learn to locate contemporary digital practices within the broader history of digital production."
\end{quote}

This description, as with the description for CRWR 2140, emphasizes student learning, and is neutral on the question of whether students should, or should not, be actively promoting, subverting, or descontructing their online presences and digital activities. These are matters for students to navigate in the context of learning environments which provide both context and opportunity.

\subsection{Part Two}

\begin{quote}
Much of the proposal deals with notions of "promotion," "selling," "leveraging," and "designing for emotion." Is there a plan to complicate or introduce comparative approaches to what "design" on the Internet entails, or is this course primarily teaching students soft marketing skills?
\end{quote}

Design on the Web is a rapidly-shifting landscape with many approaches and considerations (responsive design, mobile design, customer-focused design, user experience design, platform design, open vs. closed design, social media design, etc.). In this course we cover elements of Web design that are relevant to writers (particularly the experience layer and designing for publication).

We are not biased against promotion, selling, leveraging, or designing for emotion. On the contrary, these activities and approaches will form the basis of the future careers of our students. Students need now -- more than ever -- to explore issues such as marketing and promotion (which is one reason why Kwantlen offers degrees in Marketing). Students need the ability to be reflective and purposeful about these themes, and to come to their own conclusions (beyond the biases of instructors or of the University) about how they wish to proceed in a professional world awash in marketing, promotion, and leveraged design.

In Creative Writing, we do not treat marketing and promotion as inherently good or bad, professional or academic, useful or corrosive. Rather we help students understand how to understand these themes. We use "comparative approaches" as well as many other modalities in exploring these themes.

Our approach is consistent with Kwantlen's mission and mandate, which indicates that our programs of study "provide applied learning and broad-based university education." Additionally, the mission document indicates that "we support multiple approaches to research and innovation to address community, industry, and market needs. We encourage faculty and learners to participate in many forms of knowledge generation and research, including those focused on discovery, creativity, application, and teaching."

Discovery, creativity, and application are essential aspects of this course.


\section{Question 2: Uniqueness}

\begin{quote}
What specifically does this course offer students that other similar courses already available at Kwantlen do not? 
\end{quote}

This course is for writers.

Many courses at Kwantlen offer similar content viewed through a distinctive lens (the Fine Arts department, for example, offers curriculum for film studies that is equivalent to essentially identical curriculum in the Creative Writing department).

There is no requirement that a given course at Kwantlen must be entirely distinct from any other course.

We welcome collaboration and integration, and would be happy to explore how curriculum from various departments might be integrated or co-created. But, at the moment, there is no history of such collobration, nor any practical means of doing it, nor any evident openness to a more collegial and supportive environment in which such co-creations might take place.


\section{Question 3: Scope}

\subsection{Part One}

\begin{quote}
The course, as presented, covers a significant and diverse range of material.
\end{quote}

Our course outlines provide sufficient information such that a visiting instructor would be able to create the proper learning environment, learning experiences, and learning materials for a course section by consulting the course outline only. All Creative Writing courses are developed in this manner (which is consistent with the Course Outline manual).

\subsection{Part Two}

\begin{quote}
How can a 12-week course meaningfully instruct students in web design, writing skills for the Internet, writing for promotion, publishing, and portfolio 
development?
\end{quote}

We don't cover all of these themes in exhaustive detail (each one could be a degree in itself). We cover them all in some detail, with the general aim of offering students a means of developing their digital literacy and promoting their digital creativity (with writing, but with design as well).

Our experience has been somewhat ironic: the more details one includes in a course outline, the more questions people ask and exceptions people tend to raise. We prefer robust outlines with substantive descriptions; but other departments take different approaches. For example, the Fine Arts course noted above (FINA 2135) shows a total of 17 items for the Content area. CRWR 2140 shows 47 items; almost three times as many. This does not mean that CRWR 2140 is a longer or more detailed course than FINA 2135; it simply means that more details are articulated in the outline for CRWR 2140.

The Creative Writing department prefers the inclusion of robust details in outlines as a means of helping our cohort of instructors navigate the curriculum and the teaching process.

\section{Question 4: Code}

\begin{quote}
What does "a gentle introduction to code" mean?  
\end{quote}

Students will learn how to read HTML5 and CSS (and, possibly, some Javascript). They will learn to identify and understand the code behind compliant and responsive design. They will not learn to debug stack traces. For example, they will learn how to read this:

\begin{lstlisting}
<div class="entry group">
<h3>Creative Corrosion in Publishing</h3>
<ul class="entry-meta">
<li><h4>November 18, 2011</h4></li>
<li>Posted at 14:36 <abbr>AM</abbr></li>
<li><span class="by">by</span> Hermes Djehuti</li>
<li><a href="/">Read full article</a></li>
</ul>
</div><!-- /div>
\end{lstlisting}

They will not learn how to read this:

\begin{lstlisting}

import sys
project_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
project_dir = project_path.split(os.sep)[-1]
if project_dir == "project_template":
    dev_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(project_path, "..", ".."))
    if dev_path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.insert(0, dev_path)
    from mezzanine.utils.importing import path_for_import
    mezzanine_path = path_for_import("mezzanine")
    assert os.path.abspath(os.path.join(mezzanine_path, "..")) == dev_path

\end{lstlisting}

We believe that language which promotes optimism and encourages student confidence (language such as the word "gentle") is useful in guiding a curriculum that includes material (coding) that students often find very challenging.

\section{Question 5: Course Title}

\begin{quote}
Question #5:  The title of the course is "Writing and Creativity on the Web." Might this instead be "Writing and Creativity on the Internet"? 
Comment: The ``web'' is merely a system of interlinked hypertext documents while the "Internet" is a broader global system of interconnected computer networks that includes interfaces like IM, chat, FTP, email etc...  presumably aspects that a course like this is likely to address.
\end{quote}

The Wikipedia definition of the Internet as "a global system of interconnected computer networks" is accurate in basic terms; but, more technically, the Internet is the set of communications protocols (TCP and IP, among others) that form a network of many protocols and layers. One of these protocols (IP) now includes everything from televisions to cars to (some) refrigerators and light bulbs.

We do not focus on TCP, IP, and the many products and services enabled by these protocols. Instead, this course focuses on one protocol --  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP, commonly known as the Web). We do not explore (in this course) IM, FTP, SSH, IMAP (email), GPS, and the like. We focus on the Web, which is specific to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) documents and applications.

Because the course focuses on the Web, the course title reflects this. Our choice of the word Web (as opposed to the word Internet) is also consistent with what other departments have chosen (the Fine Arts department, for example) in titling similar courses.

\section{Question 6: HTML5}

\begin{quote}
Why is a book introducing HTML5, a hypertext markup language (which remains in an experimental phase of development) is on the syllabus? It seems well-beyond the understanding of beginner students outside computer science.
\end{quote}

HTML5 is not in an experimental phase. Since May 2011, HTML5 has been advanced to "Last Call" status as a Working Draft. The target date for Recommendation status is 2014. Moreover, much new web development is now done in HTML5 (http://www.alistapart.com/topics/code/html5/), and most high-traffic sites are built with HTML5 (Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo, Flickr, Pinterest, Facebook, Bing, Pandora, Linkedin, Typekit, and so on).

HTML5 is not new, nor nascent. Developers have been using it since before 2009. HTML5 simply includes (most of) and extends the previous version of HTML (4.01), and is the current standard for web development. In our view, all discussions of web development should include HTML5 as the foundation.

Basic literacy in HTML5 will not be "well-beyond the understanding" of students of CRWR 2140, who will already have been exposed to HTML5 in the prerequsite for this course, CRWR 1240.

Writers today need to have the basic ability to read HTML5, to alter/adapt code as necessary, and to create valid, semantically-correct, standards-compliant, responsive websites. CRWR 2140 will help them develop this skill.

\section{Question 7: Learning Resources}

\subsection{Part One}

\begin{quote}
Please say more about the selection of learning resources in relation to course learning objectives and the placement of the course at the second year level. \\
Comment: The learning resources selected for this course do not seem to reflect a scholarly or rigorous approach to the subject matter.
\end{quote}

The word "rigor" is used frequently at Kwantlen in discussions about curriculum. The argument is often made that rigor (and, by extension, scholarship) is a matter of what books students read, or what content instructors provide in the classroom. Our view is that rigor is not primarily a matter of content delivery but rather student engagement. In other words, rigor is what students do, not what instructors or textbooks say.

Rigor, excellence, and standards have little to do with the amount of content described in a course outline. In our view, rigor and excellence consist of:

\begin{itemize}

\item How much purposeful and relevant work students undertake in a given course.

\item How much depth, commitment and engagement students demonstrate in the context of their learning.

\item How much interpersonal interaction students encourage in the context of the their mentorship by the instructor.

\end{itemize}

Kwantlen's Mission and Mandate document indicates that "we provide and promote a learning environment in which learners examine and develop their values, goals, and character through the integration of personal, academic, and professional inquiry." This is the essence of rigor, and it is about what happens in the classroom, not on the page.

Furthermore, standards of rigor and excellence have not been defined at Kwantlen. The Course Outline Manual contains no information about rigor, no discussion of rigor, and no criteria for excellence or rigor. Policy L11 (which defines our curriculum development process) contains no information about rigor, no discussion of rigor, and no criteria for rigor. Policy L11 does mention "standards of excellence," which are not defined nor discussed in that policy (or in any policy).

Kwantlen's Mission calls for an approach that is real-world, applicable, community-focused, and broad-based, "to prepare our learners for a complex world." Accordingly, students in CRWR 2140 -- who are preparing for careers in the world of new publishing -- need to be reading what web publishers and web developers are reading. And they need to be participating in the kinds of creative communities that flourish (through crowdsourcing) on the Web.

At the moment, web development firms and new publishers hire very few university graduates. They prefer applicants who have real-world experience with Web design and development. These firms and publishers often note that the digital knoweldge of university graduates (their literacy with HTML5, for example, or their knowledge of online collaboration tools) is several years out-of-date. Conversely, self-trained, entrepreneurial applicants who have spent less time in libraries and more time in communities on the Web are much better prepared fo careers in new and social media. (Jason Fried Big Think interview; personal conversation with Philip Till of CKNW).

This is one of the reasons why the course outline for CRWR 2140 does not focus on library resources; we don't use them much. Instead, we use emerging technologies and practices, such as digital collaboraties, social media, and crowdsoursing. These are the tools and practices of the Web and of new publishers. If our students seek to work in the field of digital creativity (as they most surely do), they need to learn these skills as fundamental aspects of their degrees.

\subsection{Part Two}

"The statement that the library has sufficient resources in this area" is correct for the purposes of this course. We simply do not use the library (instead, we build our readings online, as almost all new publishers and new media professionals do).

\subsection{Part Three}

\begin{quote}
"The Anderson text is a popular business book that mostly discusses the online market place as a potential for niche markets..."
\end{quote}

Knowledge of niche markets, the long tail, varieties of free, and Extremistan economic environments is essential for any writer moving into the world of digital publishing. Anderson's books are unquestionably the most influential texts in this area, and students should know about them. 

\subsection{Part Four}

\begin{quote}
"...an uncritical and less than scholarly approach..."
\end{quote}

Leaving aside (for the moment) the tone of this statement -- dismissive, superior, disdainful -- the statement itself is problematic. A course outline does not (and cannot, under the current Kwantlen course development system) reflect the ways in which critical approaches and scholarship are integrated into the learning environments of classrooms. Critical thinking and critical approaches are practices and activities that students do; they are not  determined by book titles or descriptions in a course outline. Critical thinking is a practice, a methodology. Its role in a given course is not determined by the outline but rather in how the instructor engages students. The claim of an "uncritical" approach cannot be made legitimately by viewing this outline (or any other course outline at Kwantlen).

We use a rhizomatic approach in these courses. In rhizomatic learning -- probably the fastest-growing field of educational innovation in Canada, with several thousand Canadian academics currently invovled in a Massively Open Online Course based on rhizomatic methods -- the community is the curriculum.

"In the rhizomatic model of learning, curriculum is not driven by predefined inputs from experts; it is constructed and negotiated in real time by the contributions of those engaged in the learning process. This community acts as the curriculum, spontaneously shaping, constructing, and reconstructing itself and the subject of its learning... learners come from different contexts, they need different things, and presuming you know what those things are is like believing in magic... Organizing a conversation, a course, a meeting or anything else to be rhizomatic involves creating a context, maybe some boundaries, within which a conversation can grow..." (Cormier, 2012.)

In rhizomatic learning -- which draws upon research into complex adaptive systems theory, cognitive science, anthropology, and hermeneutics, "the knowledge lives in the community. You engage with it by probing into the community, sensing the response and then adjusting... It is a learning approach that is full of uncertainty, not least for the educator. But it's one that allows for the development of the literacies that will allow us to sharpen our ability to participate in complex decision making. Dealing with the uncertainty is what the learning is all about."  (Cormier, 2011.)

Phrases such as "less than scholarly [sic]" do not help to promote Kwantlen's much-needed collegiality, professionalism, and organizational development. It's unfortunate that this is the level of our discourse.

Kwantlen's Mission articulates the role of our scholarship in preparing "our learners for a complex world. We value scholarship as a socially relevant obligation and opportunity. We support multiple approaches to research and innovation to address community, industry, and market needs. Community engagement is the manner in which we demonstrate our commitment to the social value of the University."

Creative Writing 2140 focuses on relevant curriculum (socially and professionally), community and industry needs, and market conditions. The course emphasizes engagement in the real world of the Web. We read what Web developers and new publishers read; we use what they use; we do what they do. We also question, and think critically, and approach these studies with a blend of scepticism and curiosity. And we look forward to a Kwantlen in which real-world learning -- which, after all, is the basis of our charter -- is not subject to disparagement and instinctive opposition.

\subsection{Part Five}

\begin{quote}
"A cursory look at this field’s rich scholarly research reveals many possibilities for a far more university-appropriate level of critical engagement."
\end{quote}

Beneath this statement lie several assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

\item Critical engagement is contingent upon books.

\item "University-appropriate" means books authored by university professors (all of the books cited in the question were authored by university professors, mostly English professors).

\item ``Scholarly research" means university professors using methods endorsed by the traditional university system.

\end{itemize}

We question these assumptions and offer alternate viewpoints for each

\subsubsection{Books}

Books are the slowest mainstream medium. The workflow cycle of traditional, print-based publishing is currently about 18 months to two years. This does not include the length of time required to author the text; typically, anywhere from one to three years. One consequence of the publishing cycle is that the contents of books usually reflect a time period more than three years in the past. Academic books are more likely to reflect time frames that are four or five years in the past.

This is unacceptable for a course based on the Web, which rapidly evolves (Moore's Law determines fundamental revolutions every 18 months). Most content on the Web is out of date within a month. Accordingly, we use digital technologies: collaboratories, social media, blogs, web platforms. Examples include The Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (hastac.org), O'Reilly Tools of Change (oreilly.com/toc/), and The Massive Open Online Course in Theory and in Practice (mooc.ca). These resources, among many others, provide current information by leading scholars (and not only scholars in the university system).

\subsubsection{Critical Engagement}

At Kwantlen, 82 percent of first-year students achieved either less than 75 percent in grade 12 (27 percent) or lack an academic GPA altogether -- meaning they graduated high school but did not pass one or more of the 4 academic courses (including English) required for an academic GPA. This latter group represents more than half of all Kwantlen students (55 percent).

Let's be clear: more than half of all students entering Kwantlen did not pass high school.

Moreover, in the past year, Kwantlen dropped minimum entrance requirements for English to a classroom mark of C or better in either English or Communications. Kwantlen is the only post-secondary institution in the Lower Mainland that accepts Communications with a C as a minimum entrance requirement. 

So: more than half of Kwantlen's students enter our learning environment without being prepared for post-secondary studies. 

And almost half of Kwantlen's students drop out before the end of their first year (National Survey of Student Engagement).

Why?

The short answer is a lack of engagement. As an institution, we have not yet found sufficient ways of engaging students. In rising to this challenge, the Creative Writing department has become a leader in innovative and engaging approaches. Of course, that's our opinion, and it matters much less than what students say. So, what do they say? Here's a sample (drawn from various courses):

\begin{quotation}
"Every week when I came to class I felt very encouraged and inspired by all of the different creative ideas... I am walking away from this semester after putting in a great effort, with new skills and experiences that I will be able to reflect on forever."
\end{quotation}
\vspace{2em}

"This class was probably the only academic session during this semester which kept me thinking after the class and even for while after that! The course moved me to my core. I was made to go deep into analysis and simply think about my life in general, and get away from the simple small things. This does not happen a lot, especially in an academic context, and I appreciate the structure and the content of this course."
\vspace{2em}

"I have never taken a course like this before. I think there should be more courses that follow this criteria. You allowed me to take my creativity to a whole new level. I think that creativity should be a bigger part of education because it is so crucial to every individual. Creativity shapes people as individuals and gives them personality. It also allows them to experience things they never have experienced before."
\vspace{2em}

"I can confidently say that I have never enjoyed a university course as much as this one. That being said I must explain how I view things. I think it’s very unfortunate that to succeed in life I’m having to go to university and take courses that I don’t even enjoy in order to get a piece of paper after four or five years that says I have taken blank number of courses and have passed with adequate grades. That piece of paper is then somehow supposed to give me an advantage in obtaining a good-paying job so that I can then buy a bunch of stuff that I may or may not need. It makes me very depressed to think that I have spent so much of my time being miserable, just so that I can work for the rest of life. This is why I liked this class so much."
\vspace{2em}

"I was constantly reflecting on the ideas thrown in the class (by the instructor and the other students). The instructor was truly motivating, and mind-opening for me. Overall, I was continuously engaged with the message of the course."
\vspace{2em}

"I have observed students, including myself, come out of their shells, contribute with purpose and meaning to class discussion and activities, and have transformative learning experiences. This course helped in development of my academic, social, professional and personal life."
\vspace{2em}

"I was able to achieve a number of significant goals. I am more confident as a presenter. My writing, both formal and creative, has dramatically improved. I gained clarity in my journey toward graduate studies. I honed skills in communication and group facilitation that prove invaluable in my current job as an educator."
\vspace{2em}

"I have enrolled in a wide spectrum of courses at Kwantlen that span across the arts and sciences. This class has, unequivocally, had the most impact on my life. It has fuelled my passion for learning and has been a tremendous influence in my pursuit of a career in education and creativity."
\vspace{2em}

"We need a banner under which students from all disciplines can talk about and work on the things that matter and grow as people. We shouldn't split our students into intellectual and non-intellectual sides and then commit to growing only half of them. This is madness.

At Kwantlen, building student community is a particular challenge. It's no surprise; I've been in many a course in which I've sat in the front row and never gotten to know the classmates who sat behind me by face or by name. It's kind of embarrassing for me, but it should be more embarrassing for Kwantlen. You can't ignore community in the classroom and then expect it to magically appear in extracurriculars. IDEA and CRWR courses are the only ones, besides small seminars, in which I've gotten to know all of my classmates. We sit in a circle. Everyone participates. We get to know each other at a level that is unusual in the Kwantlen experience, and our ties extend past the posting of final grades.

These courses attract the kind of students who are prone to being engaged and involved citizens -- the kind of students Kwantlen struggles right now to develop. Out of a class of 20, I would say that at least 5 of us participated in the SGM to oust the old KSA council members who have been causing us so much trouble. I also recognized a number of other current and past CRWR/IDEA students helping out or voting. You just don't get that kind of commitment from a 3-hour lecture."
\vspace{2em}

"This class does not get the credit it deserves. It is a course with useful subject matter that I could apply to my future endeavours. This is not an easy class and should not be viewed as such. It is challenging and, I feel, it is neccessary for people to experience challenge in their lives. It's the only way to discover our potential."
\vspace{2em}

"I have never left a class without something written down to punch into Google -- extra-curricular study stuff. This wasn't a requirement, this was the course sparking genuine interest in me, which spurred me to continue learning in my own spare time."
\vspace{2em}

"In this class I had the opportunity to explore new things and use my experiences to deepen my creativity and personal awareness. I started the semester doubting that I had any inner creativity, and I am ending this semester with the confidence that I do. By actively exploring my own creativity outside of the classroom (during individual and group assignments) and participating in creative class activities (during other group activities), I have broadened my creative abilities. I have also enjoyed watching and listening to other peoples’ creative experiences."
\vspace{2em}

"As a student at Kwantlen for the past six years, I have mostly aimed my studies towards academic areas, such as English, psychology, mathematics, and history. Needless to say, in these areas of study, there has not been much room for personal creativity; structured and rigid course outlines are what I am used to. In this class, however, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities for personal creativity and project flexibility. This class gave me opportunities to explore my inner life, not just my academic, rational life. I feel fulfilled when I am given the chance to choose my own areas of study and exploration. Each day that I come to class, I come with an open mind, ready to learn something new. I honestly have enjoyed every activity we have done in class. These activities freed me from the sense of boredom and sterility that Kwantlen usually fills me with. This class entailed a whole lot more than just my usual classroom duties."
\vspace{2em}

"My challenge at the beginning of the course was to let go of the traditional course structure that I have been accustomed to for the past four years as a student at Kwantlen. I feel like I have changed quite a bit in terms of my understanding of what learning is and how we can teach information to others.

My classmates are all so creative, inventive, understanding, and supportive and I feel privileged to have been able to participate and actively engage in the facilitation groups and activities my classmates had allowed us to be a part of. I never thought that I would have learned about so many interesting topics.

I wish that I would have taken a class similar to this during my first year at Kwantlen and continued to do so until I graduated because it allowed me to explore a different aspect of myself, a more inventive and creative me. This class pushed me to relax and reflect on my true feelings about the personal goals I would like to accomplish and not just on the grades I want to get or which courses would look good on a potential resume. I wish I would have had the opportunity to register in more classes like this."
\vspace{2em}

"This course forces you to think about things that you normally would not. It also gives you an opportunity to explore your options and learn more about what you enjoy doing. In a way, this course took me away from reality and made me feel free and relieved from the stress we experience in our day to day lives. Normally, I often forget the material I have learned in my courses, but my experience in this course is something that I would carry with me for the rest of my life."
\vspace{2em}

"When I first attended Kwantlen in the fall of 1999 I would sit near the back of the class and would rarely open my mouth unless called upon. When I worked my way up with Safeway going from a stock boy at 19, to a meat manager at 24, and finally a district merchandiser I was still pretty much the same in terms of keeping quiet and not really speaking up unless it was about something really important. I have slowly come out of my shell and a big reason for that is having a class like this that has provided a place where I feel confident and comfortable expressing myself and sharing my ideas with other peers. I now coach senior boys basketball and have a job working for a non-profit organization.

I think that students who get though the rigours of university and who have some of the quiet shy tendencies like myself, will struggle or find themselves unhappy in the working world if they do not have the opportunity to take classes like this that provide a space for students of all different disciplines to share and express themselves and their ideas on a variety of topics and feel comfortable and gain confidence while doing so. The experiences that I have had this semester helped further remove me from my shell. I have been challenged by pushing my boundaries and rewarded with experience and new friendships with peers. I have been able to use this course to help counsel myself on who I am, where I am going, and how to get there. This has been one of the few courses that I have taken where I take it home with me, meaning I discuss with others outside of class about something we talked about or did or I will try something that was suggested in a class discussion. I was very happy with the semester, and am looking forward to building on it."
\vspace{2em}

"Creativity really seems to bring people together. For example, it was pretty amazing to see how out class interacted with one another during presentations and the hands-on components. Overall I really enjoyed myself in this course and look forward to applying the skills and lessons learned from this class into my life."

"I want to learn at Kwantlen. And from what my experience is so far, of three years, I am not learning anything. I am sitting at a table for three to nine hours a day, listening to someone rant from a chapter in a textbook, and assigning a paper that I have to recite the exact words and opinions of my professor. I say opinions because the only ideas that spawn from the classroom nowadays are opinions; the rest of teaching is from books and not from someone’s personal knowledge from where they trained. A professor needs a Ph.D to teach a class, so why are they reading off of a textbook? Why are professors not being placed at a more equal level to their students if we are relying on experience-based knowledge? And if that’s what we learn from, why is this not a part of the classroom all the time? 

This is the element that we are not supporting at Kwantlen, because we think we need to sit students in a strict environment, and subject them to a learning system that fails. When I leave a lecture based classroom at the end of my semester, I don’t remember anything from that course. Why? Because I didn't learn anything. I regurgitated notes from a professor and gave it back. I answered A, B, C, D on my final exam. I wasn’t encouraged to involve my ideas in the classroom and was instead ridiculed for them and told I was wrong. I was called flat out stupid by a teacher once, and she told me that I couldn't write because my paper wasn’t properly formatted. I took one idea from that situation, and that was to question why the ability of students and their quality of work is considered inferior because of an outdated, strict education system that we call modern?

The future of education resides in the creative process, where students are allowed to question, they are allowed to think outside of the classroom, and they are allowed to experience a class where learning is vital. And learning is vital through the engagement between students and their professors. In this class I sat in a circle with my other classmates and my professor, I remembered all of their names, I was allowed to talk to the professor like an equal, I wasn’t made to feel like I was another stupid student cashing out my hard-earned money to a professor who would most likely forget who I was, and not care about what I had to say. We worked as a team to achieve what other classes think they’re achieving; an experience that changed our lives."

"This course teaches you to find creativity in everything you do, even if you have never considered yourself a creative person. We don’t realize just how much we (should) rely on our own thought production. Unfortunately, the tendency is for students’ opinions to become products of the amalgamated information we glean from textbooks. What I have found is that this is more prevalent in some disciplines than in others. 

This teaching style and course design is what is needed in order to create new ideas and promote creative thinking. Even though I am a very outgoing person, quite comfortable in many situations, I still find that I am inhibited in many of my formal, traditional classes. I find that I have a steadier flow of ideas and stronger problem solving skills in this class than any other class."

"I will miss this class a lot; it was the highlight of my school week because every time I went I felt happy and satisfied and ready to take on the rest of my week. I am sad to leave Kwantlen, but also sad that this class has to end -- I really will miss all our activities, discussions, and laughter. I feel blessed I was able to experience it."

"I went into this class with an open mind and I told myself that my goal by the end of this class was to learn to be more comfortable with myself and to help bring out my creative side. And I feel that is exactly what I am walking away with. I feel much more comfortable voicing my opinion in front of the class and I noticed myself speaking out more in my other classes as well.

It was one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken."

Critical engagement, purposefulness, mentorship, and creativity are all foundational to our approaches to learning. Creative Writing 2140 will follow and build upon these foundations.

\subsubsection{Scholarly Research}

Every faculty member within Creative Writing is a professional writer. We don't just write about writing, we actually do it. As a group we have published more (per capita) than any other department in the university. Writing is what we do; it's integral to our professional practice. Writing is our research: heuristic, hermeneutic, rhizomatic. The scholarship of professional writing and publishing is not constrained (nor should it be) by notions about scholarly research that derive from fields contingent upon academic theory and abstraction from practice. 

In Creative Writing, theory and practice are integrated. Research and scholarship are fused with the intensely demanding task of composing literary works. We utilize heuristic research methodologies to create those works, and we employ those same methodologies to create and sustain communities of creativity. We do not simply write about the field; we are the field.

Our scholarly research is unique, and the materials we use to support that research are also unique. We use the tools of our trade, and of our peers, and of the emerging communities of creativity which we inhabit.
